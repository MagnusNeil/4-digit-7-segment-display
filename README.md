# 4-digit-7-segment-display
Arduino code for different functions with a 4-digit 7-segment display (3461AS).
This project is unfinished, but what has been published here gives a gist of how the final version is going to work.
Rather than writing abstract code, I am more interested in what the individual signals do and how they influence the circuit, hence I have opted to use binary/hexadecimal signals.
